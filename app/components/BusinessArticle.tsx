          Introduction
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The proposed concept is to create a blockchain-based political
          management system strategically designed to increase transparency in
          our government&apos;s budget and financial operations. Blockchain,
          known for its immutable and transparent nature, plays a key role in
          this initiative by making all transactions publicly available. With
          this technological backbone, comprehensive tracking of funds becomes
          possible, providing an unparalleled level of financial transparency.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          At the heart of this innovative system is an effort to empower
          citizens by giving them increased decision-making powers. This
          empowerment is achieved through a groundbreaking approach: giving
          individuals the freedom to autonomously allocate their taxes.
          Essentially, citizens are given the privilege to designate the
          institutions and sectors they want to support with their tax
          contributions. This newfound freedom allows individuals to actively
          determine which institutions should receive funding, effectively
          shaping the trajectory of social development by choosing where their
          financial support is directed and which entities may not deserve
          funding.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          In the context of this article, our exploration embarks on a
          multi-faceted journey. Initially, we begin by examining the
          fundamental rationale behind the existence and mandatory nature of
          taxes.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Moreover, our study extends to the profound impact of financing in
          shaping the evolution and development of institutions. Our goal is to
          analyze the correlation between financial support and institutional
          development, shedding light on the key role that the allocation of
          funds plays in the development and maintenance of various sectors in
          society.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Finally, we focus on formulating and proposing a new system,
          meticulously designed to exploit the potential of blockchain
          technology in reorganizing governance. Our goal is to outline the
          framework of the proposed system and consider potential methods for
          its seamless integration and implementation within existing government
          structures.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Why do taxes exist?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s start with a simple example. In small communities,
          there&apos;s often a recurring situation - the need for shared
          resources. Imagine living in a rented apartment with roommates and
          realizing there&apos;s no vacuum cleaner. Buying one individually
          could be costly and not very practical since it&apos;s not used
          frequently. However, if everyone chips in, getting a shared vacuum
          cleaner becomes a logical solution, meeting the needs of everyone
          involved. This concept of pooling resources for common goods is widely
          accepted. Similarly, on a larger scale, cities and countries have
          infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. It&apos;s more efficient to
          contribute a portion of our resources through taxes for these public
          infrastructures rather than everyone building their separate pathways.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Taxes serve another purpose - besides resource pooling for common
          goods, they facilitate development. Without the redistribution of
          wealth, not everyone would have access to education. Education, in
          turn, accelerates community and technological advancements, fostering
          overall progress.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Why are they obligatory?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Imagine a wealthy individual refusing to pay taxes, arguing that they
          don&apos;t benefit from public services. But in reality, it&apos;s
          nearly impossible to not utilize community-provided resources in some
          way. They might drive on public roads or walk on public sidewalks, and
          even the private services they use often rely on professionals
          educated through public schooling or trained in public health care
          systems. Our interconnectedness as a society spans generations;
          we&apos;ve collectively built and shared resources for ages.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Now, let&apos;s consider a working person with fewer financial
          resources. They rely more heavily on the system because they get from
          the system a bigger percentage of their income than rich people. Even
          though they contribute the same percentage in taxes as the wealthy,
          their reliance on societal support is greater. They might have
          contributed to building roads that the wealthy drive on or have a
          child who, through public education, becomes a doctor saving lives,
          possibly even those of wealthy individuals. These intricate
          connections within society are endless and showcase our
          interdependence.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Public vs. Private Services
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          When we compare different sectors like healthcare and education,
          private services often excel in quality. Yet, certain essential
          services like the police, army, and infrastructure development, such
          as roads, may not function as effectively under private ownership.
          Notably, there&apos;s a visible contrast between private and public
          education and healthcare systems.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s imagine a scenario with exclusively private healthcare and
          education. Not everyone might afford these services, even though they
          are fundamental for societal development, as discussed earlier. To
          address this, a possible solution could be the implementation of
          vouchers. Instead of funding institutions directly, providing
          individuals with vouchers would empower them to choose how to utilize
          the allocated funds. This approach could stimulate a free market
          within these sectors, potentially elevating the overall quality of
          services offered.

          The Genesis of Governance Innovation
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" fontStyle="italic" textAlign="left">
          “Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the
          energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control
          the world.”
          <br />
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="span" textAlign="right">
          ~Henry Kissinger
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body1"
          sx={{ marginBottom: "20px", marginTop: "20px" }}
        >
          The last part of the quote “who controls the money can control the
          world” is the foundation upon which the idea of the Political
          Governance Framework rests. I will discuss some of the examples
          related to the framework.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The World Economic Forum founded by Klaus Shwab whose mentor is Henry
          Kissinger proposed an agenda perfectly suited to the message of the
          quote. ESG which states for Environmental, Social, and Corporate
          Governance is a framework designed to be embedded into an
          organization&apos;s strategy that considers the needs and ways in
          which to generate value for all organizational stakeholders. ESG
          corporate reporting can be used by stakeholders to assess the material
          sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to an
          organization. In practice, the company imposes a certain framework of
          operation without which they will not be able to obtain financing and
          as a result they will not be able to beat concurrent companies that
          got financing and can develop faster. The dominant types of companies
          fitting in the framework will have the biggest impact on the market.
          For example by financing electric vehicles companies, there will be
          more electric cars than combustion cars on the streets. This is how an
          organization directs the flow of money to certain companies. Now,
          let&apos;s examine how this influence might trickle down to the
          individual level.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Looking at the present influence of individuals on government
          decisions, it&apos;s remarkably limited. Taking the polish political
          system as an example, where I reside, citizens vote for a political
          party every four years, after which their influence diminishes
          considerably. Tax payments are allocated by the government without
          citizen input, leading to scenarios where significant funds are
          channeled to state-controlled media outlets, like the substantial
          allocation of 2 billion PLN to government-controlled television. As
          it&apos;s often said, the one who controls the money wields immense
          power.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Can we empower individuals to direct where their money flows? Imagine
          if citizens could decide where their taxes went. Let&apos;s take the
          conflict in Ukraine as an example. Russian citizens opposing the
          government&apos;s actions could cut off funding to the army,
          potentially shortening the duration of the conflict. With blockchain
          technology and a novel political governance framework, this could be
          conceivable. Blockchain payment systems eliminate third-party control
          (like banks), granting individuals direct control over their funds.
          This could potentially disrupt direct government funding, enabling
          citizens to influence where their taxes are directed. For instance, if
          one believes healthcare quality is lacking, they could choose to
          allocate more of their tax money toward improving healthcare services.

          The Quest for Transparency
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          We are observing a worrisome trend—an increasing limitation on
          individual freedoms coupled with a rise in surveillance. Governments
          and corporations are intensifying their oversight of people, notably
          emphasizing control over finances. The phase-out of cash transactions
          is just the beginning. With the introduction of Central Bank Digital
          Currencies (CBDCs), governments gain the ability to monitor and
          potentially restrict how individuals spend their money. This control
          could extend to regulating personal choices, such as monitoring and
          limiting specific purchases, like meat consumption. But what if we
          could subject the government to the same level of scrutiny?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          In the media, we often hear about corruption, bribery, funding for
          terrorism and conflicts, lobbying, and dubious deals involving
          government officials. I strongly advocate for maximum financial
          freedom and privacy for individuals. However, when it comes to
          government actions and representatives, complete transparency is
          essential. This transparency is crucial to prevent the systemic issues
          I mentioned earlier, particularly because the government handles our
          collective funds.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Blockchain technology provides a promising solution by allowing for
          complete transparency in government transactions. Every transaction
          recorded on the blockchain is publicly accessible, ensuring an open
          and transparent record of the government&apos;s financial activities.
          This transparency could significantly mitigate the risks associated
          with corruption and the mismanagement of public funds.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Decentralization of Power
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Another prominent trend is the centralization of power. Over the past
          century, numerous globalist organizations have emerged, such as the EU
          and NATO. These entities enact laws that supersede those of individual
          countries, leaving citizens with minimal or no influence over their
          decisions. Even member countries often lack significant
          decision-making power within these organizations. There&apos;s a need
          for change—to decentralize this power and place it in the hands of the
          people. This shift can be facilitated by exerting control over funding
          these organizations and ensuring transparency through blockchain
          technology. Transparency can help detect lobbying efforts and unfair
          practices within these institutions.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Taxes system proposal
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Taxes should be simplified to prevent excessive bureaucracy that
          needlessly consumes time and money. When exploring different tax
          models, the simplest and most commonly utilized method appears to be
          income tax, as employed in the discussed project. The system for
          allocating taxes to specific institutions, as detailed in prior
          chapters, operates as follows.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          As a taxpayer, I&apos;m required to pay a 12% tax on my income.
          Subsequently, I have the autonomy to allocate this amount among
          various available institutions. Options include specific sectors of
          public services in my country, such as healthcare, education, road
          infrastructure development, among others. Additionally, taxpayers have
          the opportunity to choose the organizations to which their countries
          belong, e.g. the EU or NATO.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          In this system, I possess the authority to determine the allocation of
          my taxes toward specific objectives. If I choose not to allocate funds
          myself, the default proportions dictate where the money goes. For
          instance, by default, 20% of my taxes would be designated for
          healthcare, 30% for education, 20% for infrastructure, and 10% each
          for the EU, NATO, and social security.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          However, I retain the ability to customize these proportions according
          to my preferences, thereby fostering the development of specific
          sectors. For instance, if I hold the belief that the actions of the EU
          are detrimental to either myself or the country, I have the liberty to
          allocate no funds to this institution and redirect the saved amount,
          for instance, toward the military.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Blockchain Integration for Financial Clarity
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          To ensure transparency through blockchain technology, I will use the
          Ethereum blockchain as an illustrative example.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Each ministry or organization operates via its unique wallet address,
          or a cluster of addresses for risk diversification against potential
          theft. Additionally, there exists a tax office that facilitates smart
          contracts and operates as a payment intermediary. This office links
          transactions to specific citizens. The smart contract encompasses a
          payment method that, upon receiving the citizen&apos;s identifier as
          an argument, records the transaction event. Funds reside within the
          contract and are accessible for withdrawal by the respective
          organization or ministry. Each smart contract instance represents one
          of these entities, serving as the destination for tax payments.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          When a citizen visits the tax office webpage, they encounter a list of
          eligible ministries and organizations to which they can allocate their
          taxes. Subsequently, they can initiate a smart contract method with
          their identification to fulfill their tax obligations. Alternatively,
          they can complete this process directly through the webpage interface.
          The tax office then checks the smart contract logs to see if the
          taxpayer has paid the required 12% of their income. This analysis
          ensures adherence to the tax obligations set for each citizen.

          Funding Model Summary
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s delve into the key aspects of the proposed implementation:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Transparency reigns supreme. Taxpayers have the ability to track fund
          allocation on the blockchain ledger, ensuring complete visibility into
          the flow of funds and enabling the detection of any potential misuse
          or irregularities. This transparency empowers individuals to ensure
          the proper utilization of their contributions.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Direct engagement is facilitated. Taxpayers possess the capability to
          interact directly with contracts without any intermediary involvement.
          This direct access streamlines the process, allowing for efficient and
          secure transactions, thereby eliminating unnecessary delays or
          dependencies on third parties.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Simplified tax regulations pave the way. The structure of the system
          aims to simplify tax regulations, providing taxpayers with a clear and
          understandable framework for navigating them. This simplified approach
          promotes better understanding and compliance with tax obligations.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Empowerment in funding decisions. Individuals wield significant
          control over the allocation of funds to various ministries and
          organizations. This empowerment enables citizens to align their
          contributions with their priorities and values, ensuring a more
          personalized and impactful distribution of resources.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Overall, the proposed system supports transparency, direct engagement,
          simplicity in tax laws, and citizen empowerment, fostering a more
          informed and participatory approach to funding allocation.
