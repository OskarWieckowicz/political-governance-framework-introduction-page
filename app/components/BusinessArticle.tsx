          Introduction
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The proposed concept revolves around the creation of a political
          governance system anchored in blockchain technology, strategically
          designed to augment the transparency of our government&apos;s budget
          and financial operations. Blockchain, renowned for its immutable and
          transparent nature, plays a pivotal role in this initiative by
          rendering all transactions publicly accessible. Through this
          technological backbone, a comprehensive traceability of funds becomes
          feasible, ensuring an unparalleled level of financial transparency
          within the governmental framework.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The essence of this innovative system lies in its aspiration to
          empower citizens by endowing them with amplified decision-making
          authority. This empowerment is actualized through a groundbreaking
          approach: granting individuals the liberty to allocate their taxes
          autonomously. In essence, citizens are bestowed with the prerogative
          to designate the institutions and sectors they wish to support using
          their tax contributions. This newfound freedom allows individuals to
          actively determine which institutions should receive funding,
          effectively shaping the trajectory of societal development by choosing
          where their financial support is directed and which entities might not
          warrant funding.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Within the context of this article, our exploration embarks on a
          multifaceted journey. Initially, we embark on an inquiry into the
          fundamental rationale behind the existence and obligatory nature of
          taxes. We subsequently delve into an in-depth analysis, scrutinizing
          the efficacy and implications of various forms of taxation, aiming to
          discern the most efficient models for societal progress.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Moreover, our examination extends to the profound influence that
          funding holds in shaping the evolution and growth of institutions. We
          aim to dissect the correlation between financial support and
          institutional development, shedding light on the pivotal role that
          funding allocation plays in the advancement and sustenance of various
          sectors within a society.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Finally, our focus converges on the articulation and proposal of a
          novel system, meticulously designed to harness the potential of
          blockchain technology in revamping governance. We aim to outline the
          framework of this proposed system and deliberate on potential
          methodologies for its seamless integration and realization within
          existing governmental structures.

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Why do taxes exist?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s start with a simple example. In small communities,
          there&apos;s often a recurring situation - the need for shared
          resources. Imagine living in a rented apartment with roommates and
          realizing there&apos;s no vacuum cleaner. Buying one individually
          could be costly and not very practical since it&apos;s not used
          frequently. However, if everyone chips in, getting a shared vacuum
          cleaner becomes a logical solution, meeting the needs of everyone
          involved. This concept of pooling resources for common goods is widely
          accepted. Similarly, on a larger scale, cities and countries have
          infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. It&apos;s more efficient to
          contribute a portion of our resources through taxes for these public
          infrastructures rather than everyone building their separate pathways.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Taxes serve a triple purpose - besides resource pooling for common
          goods, they facilitate development. Without the redistribution of
          wealth, not everyone would have access to education. Education, in
          turn, accelerates community and technological advancements, fostering
          overall progress.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Why are they obligatory?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Imagine a wealthy individual refusing to pay taxes, arguing that they
          don&apos;t benefit from public services. But in reality, it&apos;s
          nearly impossible to not utilize community-provided resources in some
          way. They might drive on public roads or walk on public sidewalks, and
          even the private services they use often rely on professionals
          educated through public schooling or trained in public health care
          systems. Our interconnectedness as a society spans generations;
          we&apos;ve collectively built and shared resources for ages.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Now, let&apos;s consider a working person with fewer financial
          resources. They rely more heavily on the system because they get from
          the system a bigger percentage of their income than rich people. Even
          though they contribute the same percentage in taxes as the wealthy,
          their reliance on societal support is greater. They might have
          contributed to building roads that the wealthy drive on or have a
          child who, through public education, becomes a doctor saving lives,
          possibly even those of wealthy individuals. These intricate
          connections within society are endless and showcase our
          interdependence.

          Public vs. Private Services
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          When we compare different sectors like healthcare and education,
          private services often excel in quality. Yet, certain essential
          services like the police, army, and infrastructure development, such
          as roads, may not function as effectively under private ownership.
          Notably, there&apos;s a visible contrast between private and public
          education and healthcare systems.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s imagine a scenario with exclusively private healthcare and
          education. Not everyone might afford these services, even though they
          are fundamental for societal development, as discussed earlier. To
          address this, a possible solution could be the implementation of
          vouchers. Instead of funding institutions directly, providing
          individuals with vouchers would empower them to choose how to utilize
          the allocated funds. This approach could stimulate a free market
          within these sectors, potentially elevating the overall quality of
          services offered.

          The Genesis of Governance Innovation
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" fontStyle="italic" textAlign="left">
          “Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the
          energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control
          the world.”
          <br />
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="span" textAlign="right">
          ~Henry Kissinger
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body1"
          sx={{ marginBottom: "20px", marginTop: "20px" }}
        >
          The last part of the quote “who controls the money can control the
          world” is the foundation upon which the idea of the political
          governance framework rests. I will discuss some of the examples
          related to the framework.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The World Economic Forum founded by Klaus Shwab whose mentor is Henry
          Kissinger proposed an agenda perfectly suited to the message of the
          quote. ESG which states for Environmental, Social, and Corporate
          Governance is a framework designed to be embedded into an
          organization&apos;s strategy that considers the needs and ways in
          which to generate value for all organizational stakeholders. ESG
          corporate reporting can be used by stakeholders to assess the material
          sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to an
          organization. In practice, the company imposes a certain framework of
          operation without which they will not be able to obtain financing and
          as a result they will not be able to beat concurrent companies that
          got financing and can develop faster. The dominant types of companies
          fitting in the framework will have the biggest impact on the market.
          For example by financing electric vehicles companies, there will be
          more electric cars than combustion cars on the streets. This is how an
          organization directs the flow of money to certain companies. Now,
          let's examine how this influence might trickle down to the individual
          level.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Looking at the present influence of individuals on government
          decisions, it&apos;s remarkably limited. Taking the Polish political
          system as an example, where I reside, citizens vote for a political
          party every four years, after which their influence diminishes
          considerably. Tax payments are allocated by the government without
          citizen input, leading to scenarios where significant funds are
          channeled to state-controlled media outlets, like the substantial
          allocation of 2 billion PLN to government-controlled television. As
          it&apos;s often said, the one who controls the money wields immense
          power.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Can we empower individuals to direct where their money flows? Imagine
          if citizens could dictate where their taxes are allocated or prevent
          funding for certain purposes, such as in the case of a conflict like
          the war in Ukraine. With blockchain technology and a novel political
          governance framework, this could be conceivable. Blockchain payment
          systems eliminate third-party control (like banks), granting
          individuals direct control over their funds. This could potentially
          disrupt direct government funding, enabling citizens to influence
          where their taxes are directed. For instance, if one believes
          healthcare quality is lacking, they could choose to allocate more of
          their tax money toward improving healthcare services.
        </Typography>

          The Quest for Transparency
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          We are observing a worrisome trend—an increasing limitation on
          individual freedoms coupled with a rise in surveillance. Governments
          and corporations are intensifying their oversight of people, notably
          emphasizing control over finances. The phase-out of cash transactions
          is just the beginning. With the introduction of Central Bank Digital
          Currencies (CBDCs), governments gain the ability to monitor and
          potentially restrict how individuals spend their money. This control
          could extend to regulating personal choices, such as monitoring and
          limiting specific purchases, like meat consumption. But what if we
          could subject the government to the same level of scrutiny?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          In the media, we often hear about corruption, bribery, funding for
          terrorism and conflicts, lobbying, and dubious deals involving
          government officials. I strongly advocate for maximum financial
          freedom and privacy for individuals. However, when it comes to
          government actions and representatives, complete transparency is
          essential. This transparency is crucial to prevent the systemic issues
          I mentioned earlier, particularly because the government handles our
          collective funds.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Blockchain technology provides a promising solution by allowing for
          complete transparency in government transactions. Every transaction
          recorded on the blockchain is publicly accessible, ensuring an open
          and transparent record of the government&apos;s financial activities.
          This transparency could significantly mitigate the risks associated
          with corruption and the mismanagement of public funds.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Decentralization of Power
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Another prominent trend is the centralization of power. Over the past
          century, numerous globalist organizations have emerged, such as the EU
          and NATO. These entities enact laws that supersede those of individual
          countries, leaving citizens with minimal or no influence over their
          decisions. Even member countries often lack significant
          decision-making power within these organizations. There is a need for
          change—to decentralize this power and place it in the hands of the
          people. This shift can be facilitated by exerting control over funding
          these organizations and ensuring transparency through blockchain
          technology. Transparency can help detect lobbying efforts and unfair
          practices within these institutions.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Taxes system proposal
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Taxes should be simplified to prevent excessive bureaucracy that
          needlessly consumes time and money. When exploring different tax
          models, the simplest and most commonly utilized method appears to be
          income tax, as employed in the discussed project. The system for
          allocating taxes to specific institutions, as detailed in prior
          chapters, operates as follows.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          As a taxpayer, I am required to pay a 12% tax on my income.
          Subsequently, I have the autonomy to allocate this amount among
          various available institutions. Options include specific sectors of
          public services in my country, such as healthcare, education, road
          infrastructure development, among others. Additionally, taxpayers have
          the opportunity to select organizations they belong to, such as the EU
          or NATO.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          In this system, I possess the authority to determine the allocation of
          my taxes toward specific objectives. Should I choose not to allocate
          the funds myself, default proportions dictate where the money will be
          directed. For instance, by default, 20% of my taxes would be
          designated for healthcare, 30% for education, 20% for infrastructure,
          and 10% each for the EU, NATO, and social security.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          However, I retain the ability to customize these proportions according
          to my preferences, thereby fostering the development of specific
          sectors. For instance, if I hold the belief that the actions of the EU
          are detrimental to either myself or the country, I have the liberty to
          allocate no funds to this institution and redirect the saved amount,
          for instance, toward the military
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
          Blockchain Integration for Financial Clarity
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          To ensure transparency through blockchain technology, I will use the
          Ethereum blockchain as an illustrative example.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Each ministry or organization operates via its unique wallet address,
          or a cluster of addresses for risk diversification against potential
          theft. Additionally, there exists a tax office that facilitates smart
          contracts and operates as a payment intermediary. This office links
          transactions to specific citizens. The smart contract encompasses a
          payment method that, upon receiving the citizen&apos;s identifier as
          an argument, records the transaction event. Funds reside within the
          contract and are accessible for withdrawal by the respective
          organization or ministry. Every instance of a smart contract
          represents one of these entities, serving as the destination for tax
          disbursements.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          When a citizen visits the tax office webpage, they encounter a list of
          eligible ministries and organizations to which they can allocate their
          taxes. Subsequently, they can initiate a smart contract method with
          their identification to fulfill their tax obligations. Alternatively,
          they can complete this process directly through the webpage interface.
          The tax office then scrutinizes the logs of smart contracts to verify
          if the taxpayer has paid the stipulated 20% of their income. This
          analysis ensures adherence to the tax obligations set for each
          citizen.

          Funding Model Summary
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Let&apos;s delve into the key aspects of the proposed implementation:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Transparency reigns supreme. Taxpayers have the ability to track fund
          allocation on the blockchain ledger, ensuring complete visibility into
          the flow of funds and enabling the detection of any potential misuse
          or irregularities. This transparency empowers individuals to ensure
          the proper utilization of their contributions.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Direct engagement is facilitated. Taxpayers possess the capability to
          interact directly with contracts without any intermediary involvement.
          This direct access streamlines the process, allowing for efficient and
          secure transactions, thereby eliminating unnecessary delays or
          dependencies on third parties.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Simplified tax laws pave the way. The system's structure is designed
          to simplify tax regulations, providing a clear and comprehensible
          framework for taxpayers to navigate. This simplified approach fosters
          greater understanding and compliance with tax obligations.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Empowerment in funding decisions. Individuals wield significant
          control over the allocation of funds to various ministries and
          organizations. This empowerment enables citizens to align their
          contributions with their priorities and values, ensuring a more
          personalized and impactful distribution of resources.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Overall, the proposed system champions transparency, direct
          engagement, simplicity in tax laws, and citizen empowerment, fostering
          a more informed and participatory approach to funding allocation
          within the government framework.
